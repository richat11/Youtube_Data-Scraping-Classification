HUTbq-j0UU,,"In the very beginning of earth's history, this planet was a giant, red hot, roiling, boiling sea of molten rock - a magma ocean. The heat had been generated by the repeated high speed collisions of much smaller bodies of space rocks that continually clumped together as they collided to form this planet. As the collisions tapered off the earth began to cool, forming a thin crust on its surface. As the cooling continued, water vapor began to escape and condense in the earth's early atmosphere. Clouds formed and storms raged, raining more and more water down on the primitive earth, cooling the surface further until it was flooded with water, forming the seas.

It is theorized that the true age of the earth is about 4.6 billion years old, formed at about the same time as the rest of our solar system. The oldest rocks geologists have been able to find are 3.9 billion years old. Using radiometric dating methods to determine the age of rocks means scientists have to rely on when the rock was initially formed (as in - when its internal minerals first cooled). In the infancy of our home planet the entire earth was molten rock - a magma ocean.

Since we can only measure as far back in time as we had solid rock on this planet, we are limited in how we can measure the real age of the earth. Due to the forces of plate tectonics, our planet is also a very dynamic one; new mountains forming, old ones wearing down, volcanoes melting and reshaping new crust. The continual changing and reshaping of the earth's surface that involves the melting down and reconstructing of old rock has pretty much eliminated most of the original rocks that came with earth when it was newly formed. So the age is a theoretical age.

When Did Life on Earth Begin?

Scientists are still trying to unravel one of the greatest mysteries of earth: When did ""life"" first appear and how did it happen? It is estimated that the first life forms on earth were primitive, one-celled creatures that appeared about 3 billion years ago. That's pretty much all there was for about the next two billion years. Then suddenly those single celled organisms began to evolve into multicellular organisms. Then an unprecedented profusion of life in incredibly complex forms began to fill the oceans. Some crawled from the seas and took residence on land, perhaps to escape predators in the ocean. A cascading chain of new and increasingly differentiated forms of life appeared all over the planet, only to be virtually annihilated by an unexplained mass extinction. It would be the first of several mass extinctions in Earth's history.

Scientists have been looking increasingly to space to explain these mass extinctions that have been happening almost like clockwork since the beginning of ""living"" time. Perhaps we've been getting periodically belted by more space rocks (ie. asteroids), or the collision of neutron stars happening too close for comfort? Each time a mass extinction occurred, life found a way to come back from the brink. Life has tenaciously clung to this small blue planet for the last three billion years. Scientists are finding new cues as to how life first began on earth in some really interesting places - the deep ocean.",History

In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; the later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947.",History

VYRZ8wWXd0,,"The ongoing pandemic has devastated multiple economies worldwide. Yet one country gained an attractive investment from some of the biggest tech and electronic companies. That is India. More than 15 companies invested almost $20 billion in the India between April and July this year. Some of the investors were Google, Walmart, Facebook, Apple and Qualcomm. 
The International Monetary Fund predicted a negative growth rate of -4.9 per cent for the world economy in 2020 and also projected a sharp contraction by 4.5 per cent for the Indian economy. These investments were made even after this prediction.

The China factor. 
New cold war has started between US and china. And due to this many electronic manufacturing companies are relocating their manufacturing facility. For example a Major contract manufacturer for Apple is shifting six production lines from China to India with a target to export around $5 billion worth of iPhones from India, while simultaneously catering to the Indian market. Apple's vendors aren‚Äôt simply looking to make only iphones, but also planning to shift manufacturing of iPads, Mac Books and other products in the next few years. Similarly manufacturers like Wistron, Pegatron, Foxconn and Samsung are also thinking to expand their manufacturing facilities in India.

So this leads us to future for electronics manufacturing in India.
India is already 2nd largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. Yet to attract more international electronic manufacturing companies and create electronic manufacturing ecosystem, the Indian government has recently announced production-linked incentive scheme. Government already has received 22 applications from firms ranging from assemblers to electronic component producers. This scheme will provide a 6% financial incentive on additional sales of goods produced in the country over a five-year period. As per the government these companies will produce mobile phones and components worth $153 billion during this five year duration. And 60% of these products will be exported to other countries. Also these companies agreed to offer direct and indirect employment opportunities to a total of 1.2 million Indians. 
But even after being the 2nd largest manufacturer of cell phones only assembly is done in India yet all other major electronic parts are imported from different countries.
Apart from this India still lacks in infrastructure, supply chain network, and other facilities which countries like China and Vietnam provide better. 

Now comes India's tech industry.
India's is transforming in digital economy, with more than 700 million internet users and roughly half a billion expected to come. And this is an opportunity which no one wants to lose. US tech giants are trying to grab this massive market before others could do. 
Some big tech giants like Google, Facebook and Qualcomm has invested in the Indian telecom company Reliance Jio. Jio was launched as a mobile network in 2016 and has quickly gained nearly 400 million subscribers. With recent influence in e-commerce, digital payments and streaming services. Jio appears to be looking to turn the company into an all-encompassing Indian ecosystem. 
Also Jio is the only telecom company in India who has developed completely end-to-end 5G solution indigenously. 
Qualcomm which has recently invested 97.1 million dollars in jio. This will help jio to roll out the advanced 5G infrastructure and services for Indian customers. Similarly Google has invested 4.5 billion dollars in jio. By doing this Google is targeting 300 million users in India which are using basic feature phones. Google is working with Jio to create a custom Android version tailored for entry-level devices. 
Also Facebook‚Äôs 5.7 billion dollars investment in jio seems to create platform for online grocery deliveries through whatsapp and jiomart. So, all these companies are creating an ecosystem by investing in Indian companies.

After looking at all of this, still the question remains unanswered. Why India?
Well, India is the 2nd most populated globally and obviously no one would like to leave a market of this size. Apart from this the Silicon valley has been shut out by China from years. Many big ones like google, twitter and facebook are completely banned in China. Now, because of this many companies have lost the biggest market of the globe. So, companies will try to make the most of out of India. Yet India needs to make a ton of reforms to grab this opportunity of becoming a big tech manufacturer.

G-uwU5oFVM,,"Mega Manufacturing: Custom-made Volvo Trucks in Belgium | 4K Engineering Documentary

An enormous output and yet, every-truck custom-made: this is Volvo Trucks in Belgium. 

Trucks: Kings of the road with enormous power. Their manufacture demands a good eye, absolute precision and above all: perfect logistics. One of the world's largest truck factories is located in Belgium, close to the romantic town of Ghent. It's the ideal location, close to thousands of customers across Western Europe. This is where Volvo produces its bestseller: the all-time all-rounder ""FH"" - one of the most popular trucks in Europe with the most powerful engines in the industry! Approximately two hundred trucks each day! Each one unique: every truck leaving this factory is different: Mega Manufacturing individually tailored to customer requirements in a feat of logistical perfection. Timed to the minute. Around one thousand five hundred individual parts are installed by the workers in two hundred and ten operations over eight hours from the simple unadorned chassis - to a state of the art truck. 

This Mega Manufacturing takes huge amounts of energy. But suprisingly without CO2 emissions. Volvo Trucks in Belgium was the first carbon-neutral car factory in the world. As early as 2009. 
Green energy, perfect logistics, a gigantic, fully automated warehouse, modern robots: the factory is still high-tech. But nothing works here without well-trained people. Volvo Trucks calls themself a ‚Äûpeople factory‚Äú. At the moment they are testing how to support their highly-trained workforces with new high-tech equipment: exoskeletons and virtual reality glasses allow workers and computers to become one! It could become the truck factory of the future!

MGJYFa3n2_A,The Tragic History Of The Search For The Fountain Of Youth,"Throughout history, explorers ventured into uncharted territories to source a body of water that could turn back biological clocks, but how seriously did they take their quests for curing waters? Here is the perplexing, sometimes tragic history of the search for the Fountain of Youth.

Across many cultural origins, the mythical Fountain of Youth is said to possess the power to cure sickness or restore the youth of those who bathe in or drink from its waters. It has been represented as a spring, waterfall, well, or a pool. And these eternal waters are floral-scented in some stories, or described as sulfuric from their mineral-rich contents in others.

Water iconography often represents restoration or awakening. In Christianity, baptism is a spiritual rebirth, and in Hinduism, bathing in the Ganges River cleanses the soul and washes away sins. It seems almost natural then that sources of water, like a fountain for instance, became symbols for rebirth and immortality. Even today, you can find people touting miracle cures from blessed or magically imbued waters.

Interpretations of the Fountain of Youth have made appearances in art through the centuries. French ivory carvings from the 14th century depict an old bearded man entering magical waters where young, amorous couples bathe. A 1546 painting by Lucas Cranach the Elder portrays a fountain in which the aged enter on the left and exit, lithe and young on the right. These images were taken from European romance literature during the medieval period and spread throughout the age of colonization and exploration.

The only difference is that it's made from besan or gram flour instead of eggs. First they dip the breads in besan batter, then top it with vegetables and put lot of butter on top. Pudla sandwich is garnished with good amount on cheese on top. It's very yummy veg. adaptation of french toast.

All of us have heard of torque before while discussing cars and bikes. But What is torque? Let's learn what it really is and what it has to do with rotational equilibrium. 

In this video, Vikrant Kirar sits down to discuss what torque is, how it works, why it works, and what it all has to do with this thing called RPM. Torque is a measure of how much a force acting on an object causes that object to rotate.

You use torque every day without realizing it. You apply torque three times when you simply open a locked door. Turning the key, turning the doorknob, and pushing the door open so it swings on its hinges are all methods of applying torque.

History‚Äôs first empire rose out of a hot, dry landscape, without rainfall to nourish crops, without trees or stones for building. In spite of all this, its inhabitants built the world‚Äôs first cities, with monumental architecture and large populations‚Äî and they built them entirely out of mud.

iXGtx-hroKE,Working online and traveling the world - digital nomads | DW Documentary,"Working online whilst traveling the world sounds like a dream job for many people. But what exactly is a digital nomad? Pete and Supi live as digital nomads.

They travel the world permanently, work on the road and are always online. Their lives epitomize the digital revolution and how it is changing how we work live.

Many people dream of living and working on the road - a dream that has come true for Pete and Supi. Driven by a passion for travel, they set out to escape the dreary routine of everyday life. They want to achieve maximum self-fulfilment without big safety nets and full-cover insurance, in a nomadic world of adventure. Pete is a DJ, so parties and big cities are a defining part of his life, whereas Suparni aka Supi is the opposite; she‚Äôs looking for spirituality and awareness. The two show us the huge spectrum of opportunities that the world of the digital nomad has to offer. Despite their fundamental differences, they both earn their living by working remotely. The digital age has made this way of life possible: without the Internet, it would be almost unthinkable. But their lifestyle does have its limits, as is becoming especially evident to Suparni with her plans for parenthood. But it's hard to find someone you love who also loves the same sort of lifestyle, and the constant travel is a big obstacle.

O0eiiIUexY,GALLI KITCHEN By SHINE SHETTY | Inspiring Story Of How A Streetside FOOD TRUCK Saved A Kannada Actor,"#shineshetty #actor #foodtruck 

popular food truck run by kannada actor shine shetty, big boss kannada winner, inspirational story, vegetarian, mangalorean food, sabakki idli, mysore masala dosa, dose, bela kai neer dose, galli kitchen, banashankari, south bengaluru, bangalore

During a particularly difficult period in his career, popular Kannada actor, Shine Shetty took up cooking to stretch his meagre resources and feed himself. Cooking in those difficult times led him to mull the idea of setting up a food truck venture for his livelihood. Rustling up a loan from well wishers, he found a second auto that he could afford. Thus began Galli Kitchen, a streetside food enterprise, a far cry from the world of glitz and glamour that Shetty was once used to. Two years on though, Galli Kitchen seems to have changed the fortunes of its owner, and has now upgraded to a full-sized food truck. I catch up with this affable actor over an inspiring chat, and also taste some of the popular fare here.

Sabakki Idli
An idli that isn't too thick to hold, but weighty nonetheless owing to the sabudana or tapioca pearls. The aroma of the dill takes over the palate when placed in the mouth, the texture is a bit gummy. The idli is the sort that comes alive when combined with the chutneys, especially the spicy and sour notes of the kempu chutney. 
Rs. 40 (usd 0.6)
8.5/10
9/10 for the kempu chutney

Mysore Masala Dose
Shine Shetty‚Äôs ode to the 99-variety style of dose that would sustain him during his acting school days in Mumbai. The dose is crisp when it leaves the tava, but weighed down to a soft texture by the loaded stuffing of masala, fresh onions and tomatoes, when gathered into a tight roll. The spicy-sweet flavour of the podi is discernible above the fresh crunch of the veggies. Not a dose for the purist, but a tasty and filling one nonetheless.
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
8/10

Neer Dosa Bela Kai
This is how Mangaloreans love to eat their neer dose for breakfast with a lip smacking accompaniment of fresh coconut, jaggery and ghee combined together with a touch of cardamom. Simple yet delicious, and a must order to finish your thindi experience on a sweet note at Galli Kitchen.
Rs. 40 (0.6)
9/10

PM55njpHh0,Japan Travel Now Paid by Japanese Government,"Japan Government is paying everyone in Japan to travel during the pandemic.  Japan is not only encouraging its residents to travel, but actually paying them to travel Japan and vacation.  Tokyo residents who were excluded the last couple months will be included from October 1st.   I‚Äôm at Tokyo Japan‚Äôs Haneda Airport to better explain the situation.  The Japanese government launched earlier this July a Go To Travel Campaign worth 1.35 trillion Japanese Yen, about 12.7 Billion Dollars, to stimulate domestic tourism, because people stopped traveling this year because of the pandemic. Basically this government sponsored campaign, offers anyone living in Japan up to 50% off their travel including hotel and transportation such as flights and trains all included as long the Japan resident books through one of several specified travel agencies.  The Go To Travel campaign also includes includes foreigner residents  but not Japan tourists.  Each person can get up to a 20,000 yen discount per night, which is about 190 US dollars, for an unlimited amount of nights.  There‚Äôs not even a limit on how many times you can use it.  And Basically this campaign goes until the funds run out, which is expected to be in early 2021.  Obviously there are some restrictions, but you can also book day trips and hotels on your own, but at lower subsidy rate.  Nonetheless, the government is really giving people financial incentive to travel during this time.  This Go To Travel campaign is the first of a larger 4 part campaign, and will be followed by a Go To Eat Campaign, Go To Event Campaign and Go To Shopping Street Campaign. As of making this video travel into Japan by foreign tourists is still prohibited.

Five Indian firms would also be selected for the PLI scheme, which, along with two other related initiatives, could help India produce smartphones and components worth ‚Çπ 10 lakh crores ($133 billion) by 2025, Prasad said.

The smartphone industry has become a showpiece for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make In India' drive. The government now wants to make the country an export hub.

Global players such as Samsung and Taiwanese firms Foxconn, and Wistron, which both supply Apple, have already ramped up local production, attracted by the huge market of 1.3 billion people.

rn0gET8Q,Largest Fire Truck Manufacturer | Mega Manufacturing | Free Documentary,"Mega Manufacturing: Pierce - Fire Truck Manufacturer | 4K Engineering Documentary

What is created here is intended to save lives for once: Pierce Manufacturing: the world's largest manufacturer of fire trucks.

It is the largest manufacturer of fire trucks in the world: Pierce Manufacturing in Wisconsin, USA. 1400 trucks are being built here every year ‚Äì and each truck is one of a kind. Customers determine every detail from the first sketch on the 3D model to the finished truck. More than 13,000 individual components - most of them laboriously crafted by hand - are turned into an absolutely individual fire-fighting vehicle. Even the lettering and coats of arms so popular in North America are the result of Pierce's manual work with brushes and genuine gold leaf. All this is only possible with a lot of experience. The three thousand employees have on average twelve years of professional experience. After all, not just any product is manufactured here, but in case of emergencies their quality is a matter of life and death. The demands placed on a fire -fighting truck are correspondingly high: heavy as a truck, it must nevertheless be extremely manoeuvrable and fast.

Take a mega-frame, a cab equipped with lots of high-tech, a high-performance water pump and a gigantic ladder: We accompany the production of a popular Enforcer fire truck from the very first step - the construction of the chassis - to the final acceptance by the customer. One of the highlights is the assembly of the TAK4 wheel axle. Developed in the military sector, it enables cornering at top speed without tipping over. 

After approximately three months of production, the grand finale is the installation of a gigantic 33-meter turntable ladder on the roof of the Enforcer. A nerve-wracking task for the workers. Using two crane winches, they have to install the component, which weighs tons, with millimetre precision. No cable must be damaged. The final inspection shows whether the installation was successful. Then the customer receives his very own personal emergency vehicle.

ZkxRlLZ3sYQ,$2 Chicken Tikka. Indian Street Food in Delhi. üáÆüá≥,"After finishing off 30 momo between us in my Hauz Khas apartment, myself and Broke Forever went for a stroll in search of some more local delicacies.

I spotted a man pushing a cart along the road carrying oranges and a grinding machine. It was pretty obvious what he sells so I flagged him down and ordered two cups of delicious fresh orange juice.

The orange man juices the fruit with manual power. No electricity is involved. At 30 rupees a cup, considering how much effort goes into making the juice, it's superb value.

After downing the OJ's we crossed the street again where some hot food was being cooked up. One vendor had all sorts of meats on display and I pointed at one that was sitting on the cooking grill, meaning it was probably the one most recently cooked. I want to avoid anything that was cooked hours ago and has been sitting there harvesting bacteria.

What I got was Chicken Tikka drenched in butter. The meat was nice but the fact that it has been cooked and then re-cooked meant the meat wasn't as tender as it could have been. It was still delicious though and again I thought it was good value.

I had room for though and a couple of stalls down there was a vendor with Hyderabadi Biriyani. Apparently what makes the Biriyani a Hyderabadi version is a particular spice that's added to it.

We tried to order, with a bit of difficulty, half a plate but what we were served was a massive plate of chicken and rice. A bigger portion than I could finish, even with my friend trying to help me.

The taste was lovely and the meat was nice, juicy and tender. More so than at the Chicken Tikka vendor. It had a subtle taste of aniseed through it, which you may think wouldn't go well with a chicken and rice dish but I liked it, and so did the street dog that we gave the leftovers to.

I had an idea to finish the street food adventure with a nice fresh lassi in a clay cup but it seems that those fresh lassi vendors have shut up shop by the evening. We came up with a Plan B though, which was to visit Mother Dairy, a famous chain of milk vendor, and get their pre-packaged lassis.

They do have a 15 day expiry date on them so they are kinda fresh.

That was the street food tour of Hauz Khas finished but on the way back to the apartment we found a Kulfi shop and I couldn't resist. Kulfi is a type of Indian ice cream on a stick. One for now and four for the road. Fantastic.

I'm happy to say that none of the vendors in the area tried to scam or overcharge me. With Haus Khas being more of a residential area and local hangout zone you don't have to be on your guard so much as you would in the popular tourist areas of Delhi.",Food

g_gKl_x5d0A,UFOS & ALIENS - The Myth Of Space Travel | SPACETIME - SCIENCE SHOW,"For more than 40 years, people have lived in space over longer periods of time - first on the space stations Saljut and Skylab, today on the international space station ISS, and perhaps soon in a spaceship on its way to Mars. But man is not made for space. The universe is so hostile to life that humans can not survive there permanently. Skeptics, conspiracy theorists claim that all manned space travel is just a well-staged drama and the moon landing is the biggest lie of all. Since man has set out to conquer outer space and then the universe, conspiracy theorists accompany the work of scientists and explorers. And at the same time, UFOs (unidentified flying objects) have been sighted with claims of visits by your favorite martian aka extraterrestrials. Mankind‚Äôs advance into space has triggered the imagination of earthlings since humans first looked up at the stars. And so, in addition to the epochal discoveries, countless myths and legends have arisen as well. 

The world is not enough for conspiracy theories. Since the first launches into space numerous myths and legends around space travel and astronauts abounded. The first images from space depicted our planet in spherical form. ""All lies"" was a cry heard immediately from so-called experts.: ""The earth is and remains a disc"". To this day, there are advocates of the flat earth theory, which was actually refuted even before the birth of Christ.

The claim that the earth is flat was almost extinct, but the Internet is helping fuel this theory in a kind of renaissance of fools. Any kind of conspiracy theory ever invented in the context of space travel is getting a revival in the age of the world wide web. The biggest of all is the denial of the successful landing of man on the moon. 

Hardly any other human event spawned such wild speculation as Neil Armstrong's moon landing as well as the eleven other US astronauts. Just a few months after the first steps on the Moon, skeptics accused NASA, its scientists and astronauts, and the entire US government as liars. The landing never took place, the live images were recorded in Hollywood studios, the whole moon program is a huge bluff. To this day, despite proof to the contrary, the conspiracy theorists continue to beat the drum of denial. 
But there is also a lot happening on planet Earth. Ever since man conquered space, first with balloons and then with airplanes, earth dwellers regularly sight unknown flying objects: UFOs. The first UFOs were reported at the end of the 19th century; at about the same time as the first attempts to launch aircraft heavier than air into the sky. The UFOs levitate alien creatures on Earth to collect humans as research objects or to keep in contact with the powerful leaders of the world. There‚Äôs more: US military are thought to have captured several extraterrestrials and keep them hidden in a secret facility, including the flying saucers they landed with. The site: A US Air Force test site in the Nevada desert known as Area 51.
But even everyday problems and phenomena of manned and unmanned space travel repeatedly create fodder for skeptics, doubters and conspiracy theorists. Sci Fi movies are also fantastic sources for creating new myths and legends.
In this Episode of Spacetime we try to shed some light on the dark realm of conspiracies, myths and legends. Astronaut Ulrich Walter explains what really happens to people in space, should they find themselves without a spacesuit. He shows us how to live and survive in weightlessness and why even flights deep into the solar system do not have to be lethal to humans. We look at what UFO sightings are all about and what's behind them and why Area 51 is so mysterious.
We examine the surface of Mars, which appeared on the first photos of the Red Planet and terrified crowds of people. We explain the function of the warp drive and whether you can really travel through the universe with it. And of course we explain why man actually set foot on the moon.

2a4oR0ZUYE,Why Alexander The Great Is The Single Most Important Man In History,"Was Alexander The Great the most important man that ever lived in the history of mankind? It is said that he was born from Zeus himself, a demi-god in the flesh. He tamed an unbreakable wild stallion that full-grown men feared to approach at the age of 12, and that horse would carry him to military victory after military victor. His name says it all- Alexander The Great.

But how much about Alexander is really true, and what's fiction? And ultimately, with a whopping zero instagram followers, can we truly say he was all that great?

dU5223wzMsA,Trump breaks into dad dance to YMCA at end of Pennsylvania rally,"DONALD Trump showed off his awkward dad dance moves as he boogied down to YMCA at the end of a rally last night.

The president could not resist bopping to the 1978 Village People hit after a speech to a cheering crowd in Pennsylvania yesterday.

In a video, the he can be seen swaying his head to the song as he awkwardly performs fist pumps before launching into a full dance.

This came shortly after he promised the crowd he would ""make America safe again"" and ""make America great again"".

He also asked the crowd if they have had coronavirus. 

‚ÄúYeah, a lot of people. You‚Äôre the people I want to say hello to because you‚Äôre right now immune,‚Äù he said. 

Although hundreds of people were at the rally, social distancing was not practiced with few people deciding to wear masks. 

Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs visit to Florida on Monday marked his return to the campaign trail after his battle with coronavirus. 

His medical team announced he has since tested negative for the virus as the president embarked on a tour of four states in as much days. 

He thew face masks to the crowd before telling them he now felt ""powerful"" after beating the virus.

The president gave his support to COVID-19 sufferers saying: ‚ÄúTo everyone fighting to recover from the virus, I feel your pain because I‚Äôve felt your pain.‚Äù

He then offered to kiss the crowd after boasting of how he is now ‚Äúimmune‚Äù to the deadly bug. 

‚ÄúI could come down and start kissing everybody. I‚Äôll kiss every guy. Man and woman.

‚ÄúLook at that guy, how handsome he is. I‚Äôll kiss him. Not with a lot of enjoyment, but that‚Äôs OK.‚Äù

His claims of immunity is not backed by medical evidence as the US recorded it‚Äôs first case of the bug a day before the rally. 

Trump has been heavily criticised for his handling of the pandemic which has so far claimed the lives of more than 220,000 lives in the country.

F5LVBW1vl8,,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‚Äòpeel‚Äô into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled.

One of the largest and most modern excavator factories in the world. Every ten minutes, a new high-tech monster rolls off the assembly line in China.

Lingang, China. Home to one of the largest and most modern excavator factory in the world! 1000 square meters of production area, equipped with high-tech machines of the latest generation. By this means China's market leader Sany wants to become the number one in the world! 

For half a billion euros, the construction machinery giant has built the mega factory. Now 1,600 specialists ensure a breathtaking output: theoretically every ten minutes a new excavator can roll off the production line! In order to achieve the enormous number of strokes, the huge production halls are equipped with the latest generation of robots. They process up to 250 tons of steel every day. In some areas the robots have completely taken over the production of the excavators. In the state-of-the-art welding plant, for example, twenty-four workers were replaced by thirty-two robots. They do the work in half the time. And this is not the only advantage: they are more precise, safer and much more cost-effective in the long-run.

Sanys top-seller in the mid-range class: the excavator SY215. Its price: one hundred and ten thousand euros. This makes it cheaper than any competitor model from Europe or United States. Its most spectacular feature: a blackbox that sends all of the recorded vehicle-data to the control centre in China. In real-time. The Chinese produce the twenty-three ton monster in just twenty-four working hours. The specialists have to work under extreme time pressure. This is also the case at the so-called ""marriage section"" - where the heavily swaying, twelve-tonne upper part has to be moved with millimetre precision onto the narrow slewing ring. The specialists also have only ten minutes at this station. So that Sany can deliver excavators at record speed - on the way to becoming the world market leader.

""Byzantine empire"" is a made up term that appeared in the course of the 16th century to refer to that empire which once ruled Constantinople before the Ottoman takeover.

Although the empire's start date is subject to controversies, my video goes from year 395 when the empire got divided into two different entites and focuses on the Eastern part only and ends in 1461, when the last ""Byzantine"" place surrendered to the Turks.

Y2ODPFiksBE,A brief history of cannibalism - Bill Schutt,"Human cannibalism is a lot more common than you might think. Dive into its complex history and see its uses in medicine, cultural rituals and in times of survival. 

--

15th century Europeans believed they had hit upon a miracle cure: a remedy for epilepsy, hemorrhage, bruising, nausea and virtually any other medical ailment. It was a brown powder known as ‚Äúmumia,‚Äù and was made by grinding up mummified human flesh. But just how common is human cannibalism, and how do cultures partake in it? Bill Schutt explores the complex history of cannibalism.

2YSc-OBLM-,Traveling During Covid 19 - What it's really like!,"#covid19 #coronavirus #traveling
Traveling during the Covid 19 Pandemic is not impossible! If the proper safety precautions are taken, you can travel feeling safe and secure. We recently traveled from Sweden to Greece during Covid 19 and did not experience any issues. The airport in Gothenburg, Sweden was empty, however the airports in Stockholm and Athens were somewhat busy.

It's important to note that we were required to take a Covid 19 test at our local hospital within 48 hours of traveling, and there were random tests at the airports. It goes without saying, if you feel even slightly sick, do not travel! Remember to wear an N95 mask and to wash your hands regularly!

We had a trip booked to Greece before the outbreak of Coronvirus and could not receive a refund, so we decided to travel. We really feel bad for the airline industry and the thousands of airline workers that have lost their jobs. We will continue to travel by air when appropriate and when we can do it safely.

9QtNtGZh_F,"This Humble FAMILY Eatery Is Serving Honestly-Priced, Delicious COASTAL MANGALORE Food | FISH N DISH","#mangaloreanfood #seafood #bangalore

family run mangalorean coastal restaurant, neighbourhood restaurant, jp nagar, south bengaluru, fish n dish, fresh seafood, fish fry, fish curry, prawn fry, prawn curry, prawn sukka, ghee roast, kane, lady fish rawa fry, mackerel tawa fry, silver fish curry, curry, spicy mangalorean curry, fish meal, fish thaali

Harish Shetty, a native of Puttur, and his wife, Prema, uprooted themselves from their life in Mangalore five years to move to Bengaluru with their only son, Shaman, for his higher education. To earn a livelihood, they set up a small eatery in a corner of the city, with absolutely no experience but compelled by necessity and their love for cooking the food of their native land. Despite all odds, their tiny shop, Fish N Dish, prospered modestly over the years. The current situation brought all that to nought as they lost their meagre staff, most of their business, and were forced to fend for themselves to stay afloat. Alerted by our viewers of their plight, I paid an impromptu visit to find the couple cooking in the kitchen, serving customers and also cleaning up after them, assisted by their son. The delicious homestyle Mangalorean food that I tasted fuelled by Harish and Prema Shetty‚Äôs motivation to provide for their son a better life inspired this episode. Hope you enjoy this one, please support them and neighbourhood eateries like these if you can. 

Lady Fish Rawa Fry
A delicate crust conceals the lady fish, smeared with a gentle masala that‚Äôs seasoned to perfection. The fish is fresh and flakey, the perfect size to peel away at its flesh, definitely a fry to order when here
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7) for one fish
9/10

Prawn Sukka
The coconut is the perfect sponge to soak up the flavours of the masala and also the slight sweetness of the prawns. The coconut masala, toasted curry leaves, ginger garlic and green chilli combine supremely with the prawns that have been cooked to just the right texture. 
Rs. 300 (usd 4.1) 
9/10

Squid Ghee Roast
The ghee roast masala is warming and ‚Äòkadak‚Äô in its punch and laced with the generous ‚Äòbutteriness‚Äô of ghee. Would order the ghee roast here again, but perhaps with fish or chicken. 
Rs. 220 (usd 3) 
8/10

Mackerel Fry (Green Masala)
You can taste the fresh herbaceousness of coriander combined with the zing of mint and the spicy heat of green chillies. It‚Äôs a masala that‚Äôs robust enough to take on the strong flavours of the mackerel.
Rs. 130 (usd 1.8) per fish
8/10

Mackerel Tava Fry (Red Masala)
A deep-coloured masala that greets you with its spicy punch and has seeped into the core of the fish.
Rs. 130 (usd 1.8) per fish
8.5/10

Fish Thaali
A complete meal that includes a mackerel curry, mackerel fry, some vegetable, pickle, rice and neer dosa, guaranteed to satisfy, taste-wise and also fill you up.
Rs. 150 (usd 2)
9/10

Silverfish Curry
A gentle curry with the creaminess of coconut milk and mild flavours of the fish, the fish is the sort that one can devour completely, bone and all. A traditional silver fish curry would also have a bit of tartness that I missed in this preparation. 
Rs. 150 (usd 2) 
7.5/10

Mackerel Pullimunchi
The curry is nice and thick, however to a Mangalorean, it may seem a trifle compromised on the chilli and tamarind punch that one would expect to find in a traditional Puli (sour) Munchi (chilli). 
Rs. 150 (usd 2) 
8/10

Yutzg2NLwcU,Giant Aircraft: Manufacturing an Airbus A350 | Mega Manufacturing | Free Documentary,"Mega Manufacturing: Airbus A350 | 4K Engineering Documentary

Assembled in France using millions of components made throughout Europe: The A350 is the most modern commercial aircraft in the world. 

The Airbus A 350: the most modern commercial aircraft in the world. It takes 1800 highly-skilled specialists in Toulouse, France, and 2.5 million individual parts, delivered from all over the world, to assemble this masterpiece of aeronautic engineering. The goal: An aircraft with minimal consumption and maximum range. 53 percent of the Aircraft consist of a modern ultra-light composite material. But the innovative material also requires entirely new manufacturing processes. A challenge for the aircraft manufacturers in Toulouse. And the final assembly is preceded by a logistical masterpiece: The individual parts of the aircraft travel from various Airbus plants in Europe to Toulouse: the front and centre sections from Saint-Nazaire in France, the tail section from Hamburg, the wings from Broughton in Wales and Bremen, and the tail fin from Getafe in Spain. The factory in Toulouse is supplied with these parts by a specially developed transport aircraft, the Beluga. Several times a day, five of these machines commute between the various plants and bring supplies for production seven days a week from early in the morning until midnight. And the journey of the components is not over in Toulouse. By the time the A350 is fully assembled it will have passed through seven hangars or ""stations."" Given the extremely high number of components that have to be assembled and the large number of different suppliers, there are a lot of risk factors involved in the production of the A350. And the pressure is high: The modern aircraft is extremely popular with airlines, with 890 pending orders to date. Ten aircraft of the A350 have to leave the factory every month no matter what.

today in this video you will see food production process in factory
Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines, tools, chemical or biological processing or formulation and is the essence of secondary industry. The term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers).

qnxq0L8tckk,The New Normal of Airline Travel - What‚Äôs Changed?,"I have observed 5 ways that commercial air travel has changed, since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

1. Airlines are retiring 4 engine, less fuel efficient, airplanes such as the B747 and A380.

2. As a result of lower demand and removal of the B747 and the A380, there are less or almost no First Class seats available.

3. Airplanes are cleaner now than ever. There is strong emphasis on the hygiene of air travel at the moment. Does social distancing really work in the air?

4. We are seeing drastic changes in how the in-flight service is conducted. Some airlines are downgrading their in-flight meals significantly. Hot meals and trays are being replaced by sealed and pre-packaged cold snack boxes. I will discuss the different in-flight service standard of British Airways, Turkish Airlines, Singapore Airlines, ANA, Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad.

5. Flying will become a necessity only for those who need to, it won't be for fun any more and will not be as easy as before. A lot of cumbersome paperwork, travel approvals and Covid tests are needed for international travel at the moment.
